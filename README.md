konami_letters
==============

A konami code script that re-arranges the letters on your page to do ... something. 

TODO ::: 
----
- use babel and break up script into modules
- make the array of characters pluggable. 
- stop using jquery 
- create a pattern that will work for Danielle. ie. a monster face. 
- try to 'freeze' the letters on the page before moving things around. 
- consider only using < 300 letters on the page so as to not overload your browser?
